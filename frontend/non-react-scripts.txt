For Option 3 (creating a simplified version without react-scripts), you will need to make some changes to your project structure. Here's what you need to do:

Location of webpack.config.js:

The webpack.config.js file should be placed in the root of your frontend directory, at the same level as package.json.


Changes needed to existing files:

You won't need to change your React component files or their structure
Your src directory structure can remain the same
You'll need to modify your package.json to remove react-scripts and add webpack dependencies


Additional dependencies to install:
bashCopycd frontend
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react style-loader css-loader postcss-loader

Create a babel.config.js file in the frontend directory:
javascriptCopymodule.exports = {
  presets: ['@babel/preset-env', '@babel/preset-react']
};

Modify your package.json:
jsonCopy"scripts": {
  "start": "webpack serve --mode development",
  "build": "webpack --mode production"
},
And remove the dependency on "react-scripts".
Postcss configuration:
Make sure you still have your postcss.config.js file for Tailwind to work:
javascriptCopymodule.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  }
};


This configuration will allow Webpack to directly build your React application without relying on react-scripts, which should help bypass the dependency issues you're experiencing. Your application code (components, services, etc.) doesn't need to change - you're just changing the build system that processes these files.
One more thing: if you're using any environment variables (process.env.REACT_APP_*), you'll need to add the DefinePlugin to your webpack config:
javascriptCopyconst webpack = require('webpack');

// Add this to the plugins array in webpack.config.js
new webpack.DefinePlugin({
  'process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL': JSON.stringify(process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL)
})
Replace REACT_APP_API_URL with whatever environment variables your application uses.
